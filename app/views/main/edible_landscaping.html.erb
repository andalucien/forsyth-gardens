Edible gardens are beautiful in flower, foliage, fruit, as well as function!  With the current energy crisis and food crisis, it has become a moral imperative to grow as much of our own food as possible.  Let your yard provide for your table without sacrificing aesthetic qualities.  Kitchen gardens can fill your fridge with vegetables, fruit, and herbs and your home with cutflowers.

Create a new yard-sized Garden of Eden by planting an ecological orchard.  Edible Forest Gardens are based on natural ecologies and overflow with useful and edible plants, including fruit and nut trees, berry bushes, fruiting vines, and layers of herbs and perennials serving a wide variety of ecological purposes.   From standards like cherries, pears, and peaches, to more exotic  figs, hazelnuts, and hardy kiwis!
